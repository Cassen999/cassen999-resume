      <h2 class="summary">Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cassen Gerber. I am a 29 year old full stack software engineer
          from Minneapolis Minnesota. I got into development while in my previous career
          as a barber when I realized, after trying a few different scheduling apps,
          there were not really any that were specific towards barbering. Seeing this 
          huge market gap, I decided to pursue software engineering to hopefully help 
          out the shop that I left. 
            When I am not working on websites or software, you will probably find me 
          playing video games with friends, watching Friends with my wife, or trying
          to keep my two cats (Winry and Spirit) from destroying our house.
        </p>
      <h2 class="what-i-do">What I Am Doing</h2>
        <p>Right now, I am finishing up my schooling to become a full
          stack software engineer. I am passionate about making software
          and web pages that work not only for the company or person(s) that
          I am making it for, but also those that are interacting with the 
          creation. My goal is to make websites and software that work for 
          you and to streamline your job so you have more time to do the things
          you enjoy!
        </p>
